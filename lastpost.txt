 As most of you probably know  I m pretty much the equivalent of a newborn in the world of free software  This open source gig has been going for almost    years  but I only got involved within the last    months  So  consider this the opinion of a  young  non geeky  outsider looking in who s now experienced the full force of Ubuntu   During Mark s keynote at the last Ubuntu Developer s Summit in Brussels when I wasn t hastily taking pictures and  I enjoyed listening to some of what Mark had to say   particularly this thing about crossing the  chasm    In free software there are a tonne of annoying people  including me   I suppose that can be said for any community  Possibly one of the most annoying groups of people are the extremist diehard Linux geeks   you know  the ones that refer to it as GNU Linux  run as many commands as they can from a terminal window and think that taking their dog for a walk is adequate exercise for a year  I m aware of the blatant stereotype  Let me continue    The simple fact is that everyone on the  other  side of the chasm  you know  normal people  don t care about freedom so much  They don t give a rat s ass that Docky is written in mono or that some of the artwork for Ubuntu is created in Photoshop  Case in point  Look at how many people use Facebook or Twitter  There are a number of reasons why these services are popular  but generally the main two are   a  their friends use it b  it s cheap  and in this case  free    Unfortunately it is true that exactly the same thing can be said about clothing manufacturers who utilize cheap production methods  or companies that genetically enhance vegetables and fruit  In the first instance  people buy the stuff because it s trendy  a   in the second  because it tastes good  In both cases  the cheaper price is certainly a huge factor  b    In my own life I have learnt to minimize the amount of friends I have who are vegetarian  religious or have extreme views about something  If I didn t  I d probably be so depressed from being lectured and told off all the time for eating meat or not believing in God  I went to a religious school and spent    years going to Church for an hour every week  Thankfully they valued teaching both sides of the story  and I made an informed decision to not be religious   In my opinion  the worst kind of are the people who refuse to use Twitter  Facebook  or even any Google product due to privacy concerns  Dude  you re a    year old with a neck beard living in your Mum s basement  no one cares enough to breach your privacy and steal your mainframe   I use Docky because it gets the job done and it looks pretty  I also dual boot with Windows   because I use Photoshop for design  Does that make me a bad person  Does eating meat make me a bad person   In an ideal world i d probably be looked upon as the worst thing since black jellybeans  but unfortunately we don t live in an ideal world   Do you really  really believe that Android is in widespread use because it was marketed as being free as in speech   No  of course not  It s mainstream because it works  looks good  and offers consumers a choice other than what Apple has on offer at a cheaper price    So  sorry free software evangelists but I bring some bad news  The only way we re going to cross the chasm is by being better than the competition  and if that means Canonical has to do some  or keep the Ubuntu One server code closed source  then so be it   Up until now  Canonical have always open source their code in the end    If the product benefits as an end result  who s complaining other than this small vocal minority who put off the rest of us  The worst thing is that this minority is usually the same people who are in a position of responsibility or decision making   All you have to do is go and read  by Alan Cooper which was first published over    years ago and you ll see so many similarities to the present  it s mind boggling    we re still serving up exactly the opposite to what real users want and then forcing them to learn all this crazy shit developed by programmers who laugh at anyone who doesn t know what a terminal is  And if the end user fails to understand it  then we criticize their intelligence in a condescending manner   Until we change this attitude where  M  is the devil   and actually try to create something for them and not us  I fail to see free software taking off based on principle alone   that s if you want it to take off in the first place   Discuss   Edit  Just to avoid some confusion  this post is about people who are in your face about open source  There are plenty of developers who have their own beliefs but don t try and slam it down your throat  I ve met a lot of developers and I am good friends with many people in the community and at Canonical  in no way would I want to disrespect their hard work that they put in every day on making open source software rock   This is just my opinion  What you think is of interest to me  and I read every single comment  What is not of interest to me are comments that use profanity  so keep it clean please        is the founder and leader of the   an Ubuntu member  and was sponsored by Canonical to attend the Ubuntu Developers Summit for the Maverick release earlier this year  He studies design and psychology at the University of Otago in Dunedin  New Zealand  When he s not upsetting the internet by writing controversial articles  he also has a pilots licence and plays the drums  trumpet and guitar  Benjamin enjoys the work of Seth MacFarlane
